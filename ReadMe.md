This is a simple React project that displays cryptocurrency news from an API. It is an easy project created solely for the purpose of practicing my skills. I have been working on various small React projects to improve my skills, and this is one of those projects that will help you fetch news from a very cool API.

In this project, I have designed some stylish news cards that will showcase the news fetched from the API. Additionally, I've utilized Tailwind CSS for styling purposes throughout this project.

This project is built using React with Vite.

Feel free to contribute.
